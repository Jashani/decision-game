## Flow

### 1. Character Introduction

1. Four characters are presented and a reliability rating is asked for each character.
    2. In ideologically charged rounds, each character has a visible political alignment (Democrat, Republican).
    3. In neutral rounds, characters have no visible affiliation.

### 2. Accusations

1. Each character accuses one other character of leaking information.
2. The accusation structure is drawn from one of several predefined probabilistic patterns.

### 3. Belief Assessment

1. Participants rate the likelihood (0–100) that each character is the leaker using a horse-race style slider with draggable icons.
2. Participants rate the reliability of each character (1–7 scale).

### 4. Final Judgment

1. Participants select one character as the leaker.
2. Rate confidence in their choice.

### 5. Scoring & Feedback

1. If the correct character is selected, points are awarded.
2. No correction or debriefing is shown mid-game to preserve immersion.
